<ul> Quotes:
  <li> A quote from Dr. Lim - "spontaneous" </li>
  <li> "She's buff, she's really really buff" -Cara </li>
  <li> "My favorite student Anisa, my coder wifey. She's genuine unlike my other students. She has a natural inclination towards coding and is truly an inspiration to her peers.
     Unlike the others in my class, she quickly understands the material like no other. I have never seen such an outstanding coder. I wish I had her talent when I was her age. I shall leave you with these words...
     The new Steve Jobs! She is the better female version of Elon Musk." -Gaby </li></ul>
